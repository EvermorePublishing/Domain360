# Rubisco Inbox
[**Rubisco Inbox**](https://rubisco.pages.dev/inbox/) is an email inbox aggregator service created by [Rubisco](https://rubisco.pages.dev/). It lets users view their Gmail inbox by signing in with their Google account(s). It uses the [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides) to function.

The service is free to use for anyone who has a Google account. Unlike a normal webmail or emailing service, Rubisco Inbox does not let users send or reply to email.

The service is available on both desktop and mobile devices. Later on in 2025, there will be a PWA version of the service. Rubisco Inbox works by letting user click on one of their emails in their Gmail inbox and viewing the whole content, without the normal clutter of Gmail. They have the option to see the original email in their actual Gmail inbox.

The service is currently only in English, but users can easily translate the UI using the 'translate page' feature on most modern browsers like Chrome or Edge.

The service is proprietary but uses open-source components like the Home UI library designed by Rubisco, which is based on Material Design Lite.
