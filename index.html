## Server360 Sites
**Server360 Sites** is our [web hosting service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service) which runs on [Domain360](https://github.com/server360group/Domain360) a GitHub repo and service, which uses [GitHub](http://github.com/) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) integrations to run. Server360 Sites is free for anyone to use, with oversight by our teams.

## About {#about}
Server360 Sites was created in 2025 to fulfill our goal of creating a web hosting service, which was one of Server360's original purposes. We tried different ways of making this dream a reality back in 2020 when we were first founded, including a private hosting system where people had to contact us first. This way didn't fit our objectives, so we took a break and eventually, we learned about Cloudflare Pages!

The service works by having users create what we call 'minisites,' or subdirectories within the server360.pages.dev domain. Thus, users don't create their own custom domains, they just create new folders.

All minisites hosted by Server360 follow the same URL patterns, i.e., `server360.pages.dev/your-minisite/` or `server360.pages.dev/your-minisite/folder/` or any other way you want your minisite to be structured!

## How to use {#how-to-use}
Server360 Sites is meant to be a fairly simple and free way to host your minisites. However, there are some things you must do before your minisite can get published.

### Creating a minisite {#new}
To get your minisite hosted on Server360 Sites, you must do the following:
1. Fork the official [Domain360](https://github.com/server360group/Domain360) repo on GitHub.
2. Create a new **folder** in your fork and add all of the files you need for your minisite.
    - If a folder with the minisite path you want already exists, then you will have to choose a new path for your minisite. Your pull request will be denied if you delete or tamper another person's minisite or files.
3. Create an `about.txt` file that has your name and an email address we can use to contact you directly, a description of your minisite, and how often you plan to update your minisite.
    - **Important:** Your `about.txt` file should be in the root of your minisite's folder. Subfolders in your minisite do not require an `about.txt` file.
    - **Note:** You are allowed to create multiple minisites if you want. For each new minisite, you will need to create a new `about.txt` file.
4. Submit a pull request to merge your fork with the official Domain360 repo on GitHub.

**Note:** It can take upto seven business days to get your minisite published or updated right now. We're still working on making the process faster!

**Important:** If any of the information in the `about.txt` is missing, we will not approve your pull request.

### Updating a minisite {#updating}
If you want to update your minisite, you must do the following:
1. **DO NOT** create a new fork, use the one you made originally to create your minisite.
2. Update, add, or remove your minisite's files (in the **original** fork you made).
3. Create and submit a new pull request for the offial Domain360 repo on GitHub.
    - **Important:** You must detail the changes you made to your minisite in your pull request in order for your minisite to get updated! If your pull request doesn't contain any information about your changes, it won't be accepted.
4. Wait for your minisite to get updated.

**Note:**  If you change one of the directories in your minisite, then the link will be broken and an error page will be shown instead of the proper page. Keep this in mind when renaming folders in your minisite!
