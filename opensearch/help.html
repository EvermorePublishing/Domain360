# Evermore OpenSearch Help
**Evermore OpenSearch** is a free-to-use web tool created by Evermore to make it easier for catalogers to create a custom search engine based on any of their [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com/).

## Getting started
To create your own search engine with OpenSearch, do the following:
1. Log into your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/) and create a new [Sheet](https://sheets.new).
2. Fill in the data into the spreadsheet and give the document a title (i.e., My Spreadsheet).
    - **Reminder:** The first row (A1-Z1) should be reserved as titles for fields in your spreadsheets.
3. Set the share settings to **Anyone with the link**.
4. Copy the **Sheet ID** to your clipboard (i.e., https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/SheetID-Here/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
5. Copy the **Sheet Name** to your clipboard (by default it should be "Sheet1")
    - **Important:** If, for any reason, you change the Sheet Name, you must edit your OpenSearch Shareable ID (OSSID).
6. Go to the OpenSearch link generator and paste the releavant information into the input boxes.
    - **Notice:** By default, we have the Sheet Name set to "Sheet1". If your Sheet Name is different, make sure you change it!
7. Click the **Get Shareable Link** button and copy your OSSID. Anyone will be able to search your spreadsheet now!

No one besides you will be able to edit the original Google Sheet, unless you share it with them specifically. If you make changes to the spreadsheet's data (but not the Sheet Name), then your OpenSearch search engine will be updated!
